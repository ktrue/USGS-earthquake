Readme file for quake-json.php
Version 1.00 - 08-Sep-2012 - initial release
Version 1.01 - 03-Jul-2016 - updates for mandatory Google Browser JavaScript Map API key
Version 2.00 - 10-May-2018 - rewrite to use Leaflet/OpenStreetMaps+other tile providers
Version 3.00 - 13-Nov-2019 - added optional fault/tectonic plate displays to maps, added NatGeo and Delorme maps

With Version 2.00, you no longer need an API key for multiple map tile providers to use the script.

If you wish to use the OPTIONAL Mapbox.com tiles (terrain3, Satellite maps), you will need a Mapbox.com API key
which can be acquired (for free with 50K accesses usage/month) at:

https://www.mapbox.com/signup/?

in the quakes.php script you can put

$setMapboxAPIkey = '-replace-this-with-your-API-key-here-'; 

 Note: if using the Saratoga template set, put a new entry in Settings.php

$SITE['mapboxAPIkey'] = '-replace-this-with-your-API-key-here-';

Note: a Mapbox API key is OPTIONAL .. you do not need it to use maps from 5 included free map tile providers.

The quake-json package will read the GeoJSON file from the US Geological Survey for earthquakes worldwide over the last 7 days.
For the USA, magnitude 1.0+ quake information is available.
Outside the USA, only quake information of magnitude 4.0+ are available.

Package contents:
./ajax-images/*.png   contains markers for use with the quake-json.php script
quake-json.php        main script
quake-json.js         support JavaScript (contains markerclusterer and sorttable scripts)
quakes.php            sample script for calling the quake-json.php script with arguments
wxquake.php           sample AJAX/PHP template page using quake-json.php script for data
README-quake-json.txt  this file.
quakesjson.txt        sample cache file of page returned from USGS GeoGSON query

If at all possible, consider NOT modifying the quake-json.php script when doing customizations .. it
will make it easier on you to just replace the quake-json.php script when updates are available.
Instead, modify either quakes.php or wxquake.php settings areas.  Also, most of the settings are available
in Settings.php $SITE[] variables to override any settings in the wxquake.php page.
See the README.md for details.

For AJAX/PHP template users, the following entries should be added to the language-LL.txt
translation file (LL= language translation id)

Note: the |of| entry below is used in the reports for quake location as in:
  20 mi NNW of Saratoga, California

The cardinal wind direction will be automatically translated ot other languages.
